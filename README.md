# Composite WordPress Theme
Composite WordPress theme integrates Tailwind CSS and makes use of adapted versions of the Tailwind UI component collection. Composite requires ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) Pro version. This requirement is because the theme utilizes ACF fields to make it's components dynamic, and also utilizes ACF fields to build it's settings pages.
